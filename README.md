# Chat-Roleplay

This project aims to create a customizable roleplay experience with Discord chatbots.

It is still in very early stages and so bugs should be expected.

## Credits
I would like to give credit to https://github.com/doki-doki-ai-edition/discord-bot for giving me the inspiration to try my hand at creating a similar project, but with a more generalized approach to allow an undefined number of characters to be seamlessly added through the config.
